# FileMan
RCOS Project

Description: 

Document management is an important aspect of many jobs from accountants to restaurants. There is no shortage of file management softwares, but all seem to fall short in one aspect: storage. These companies make most of their profit on upselling storage costs, offering 15 gb for $20 a month. The storage itself is incredibly cheap, with AWS offering 50 gb for $0.10 a month. The goal of File Man is to create a document manager that connects to any database. Companies and individuals can use whatever storage system they prefer, from their own hard drive to AWS, cutting the cost to store files. File Man will be an online application and will be geared towards commercial use, including features such as customizable fields and exports.
